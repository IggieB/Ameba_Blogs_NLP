## General Description üìã

This project is part of a seminar paper attempting to explore which insights regarding Japan's birth crisis can be found in related blogs on the popular platform [Ameba Blog](https://www.ameba.jp/). 10,000 posts were sampled based on the internal ranking lists of five related categories (fertility, pregnancy journaling, childrearing, etc.) and processed using several transformer-based models for Japanese corpora. 

## Project Steps üìù

- Scraping the 100 leading blogs (and user details) in the five categories chosen for the project (2.9.24)
- Scraping the last 20 posts from each blog (2.9.24)
- Pre-processing all the text samples for the analysis
- Processing the posts, which included n-gram generation, clustering, topic modeling and sentiment analysis (a keyword extraction function was also written but the results were not used)
- Plotting the results after saving them as CSV files
